# React Portfolio
Project About creating a responsive portfolio in React using reusable and styled components. 


## The problem
Had some strugles with time this week, so still have some work to do with the components - code and style

## View it live
Tried to upload the portfolio to Netlify from GitHub as usual, but this time it didn't work... Will update with link later when it works.
