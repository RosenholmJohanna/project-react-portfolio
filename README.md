Project About creating a responsive portfolio in React using reusable and styled components. 


## The problem
Had some strugles with time this week, so still have some work to do with the components - code and style
Got some issues with uploading the portfolio to Netlify, but now it works! :)
But still have some components and style that needs to be worked on.
